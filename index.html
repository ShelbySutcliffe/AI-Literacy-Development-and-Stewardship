Dear Ms.Sharma,
From designing AI-driven mapping tools for supply chain planning to creating persona-based learning experiences for diverse audiences, I have built a career at the intersection of creativity, technology, and human-centered learning. With a formal education grounded in communication, media production, and editing, I have consistently translated complex technical and organizational concepts into accessible, actionable insights—whether through workshops, webinars, or tailored training programs.

My draw to The American Red Cross is deeply personal and enduring: a lifelong commitment to volunteer stewardship and compassionate service, paired with the mission to relieve suffering and strengthen communities. This aligns seamlessly with my professional ethos. At NH MEP, for example, I designed AI-integrated tools and facilitated workshops that enabled 3rd-tier manufacturers to engage with Department of Defense infrastructure programs, translating technical concepts into language that diverse audiences could understand and act upon. Similarly, in healthcare and legal contexts, I have developed training, documentation, and workflow improvements that made complex processes clear and achievable for both technical and non-technical professionals.

I am energized by opportunities to recognize patterns, integrate iterative process improvements, and embed ethical frameworks into learning and operational models. The prospect of advancing AI literacy within the Red Cross—ensuring responsible adoption, transparency, and accessible education—resonates strongly with my experience and values. I am eager to contribute my combination of technical fluency, curriculum development expertise, and compassionate stewardship to support your mission.

Thank you for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and approach can strengthen AI literacy and responsible technology adoption at The American Red Cross.

Sincerely,
Shelby Sutcliffe O’Donnell`;
